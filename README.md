# tensorflowclothes
A python project that can sort out different images of clothes into groups using tensorflow.
I use a set of 60000 training images and I normalize them in order to use less amount of pixels and make it more efficient
The results obtained are more or less 92% of correct answers with 20 epochs of training.

Future updates include a file convertion into tensorflow.js in order to make it work on a website
A small website frontend for the application
